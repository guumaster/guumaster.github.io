My name is Gustavo Marin. I'm a programmer that thinks needs a blog, but never have time to maintain it. As lots of other programmers, 
I like the idea to blog regularly, but then the hassle of keeping alive becomes a burden. 

So, Â¿What about me? I like code. A lot. Its like a puzzle that you have to invent the pieces and put it together on the fly, 
but once you are done, is really satisfying.
 
Usually I code for work, but also spend some time learning new techniques here and there. 
I like to program simple things to test new languages or ideas. And that is what you would mainly see on my [public Github](https://github.com/guumaster/).
